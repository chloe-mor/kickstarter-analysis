# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
### Purpose
This project compares the outcomes of Kickstarter campaigns based on both their launch date and their fundraising goal. The purpose of the project is to provide Louise with clear visuals that depict campaign outcomes based on launch dates and campaigns based on fundraising goals so that she may compare her campaign to others in a similar category.

## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
It was most efficient to organize the campaign outcomes based on launch date in a line graph. The data is grouped by month, as seen on the x-axis, and the number of campaigns is measured on the y-axis. Each line represents a different outcome category: successful, failure, or cancelled. To understand the graph, Louise has to pick a month on the x-axis and travel up the y-axis until she reaches a dot for each outcome category.

A few observations we can make about the graph:
- No matter what month it was, there were always more successful campaigns than failed or cancelled ones.
- Across all months, there were very few cancelled campaigns. In fact, there were not any cancelled campaigns in October at all. 
- May had the highest number of successful campaigns and December had the lowest number of successful campaigns. 
- May also had the highest number of failed campaigns while November had the lowest number of failed campaigns.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
In order to view the relationship between campaign outcomes and fundraising goals, we also used a line graph. The fundraising goal ranges are listed on the x-axis, and percentage of campaigns is listed on the y-axis. Again, each line represents a different outcome category.

Some observations we can make about this graph are...
- One hundred percent of the campaigns that had goals between $45,000 and $49,999 were failed.
- Campaigns with fundraising goals of less than $1,000 had the highest percentage of success.
- Zero percent of the campaigns included in this graph were cancelled. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
One of the biggest challenges about these graphs is they are not set up to clearly tell us what they are measuring. If Louise was to look at the graphs alone with no additional information, she would have no idea how many campaigns were included, what years they were launched, what category/subcategory they were in, etc. This makes it difficult to apply the analysis to her Kickstarter campaign, because she's not sure if they are at all comparable. 

The graphs are also being measured differently -- either by number or a percentage. It hard to analyze the graphs at a glance when they do not use the same unit of measurement. 

## Results
***What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?***

1. It doesn't look like the month a campaign is launched has much to do with whether or not it is successful. The number of successful campaigns each month is always higher than the number of failed campaigns in that same month. 
2. There seem to be a lot of campaigns that launch in the spring.

***What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?***

We can conclude that campaigns with fundraising goals less than $15,000 are more successful. 

***What are some limitations of this dataset?***

The dataset includes campaigns from many countries. The outcome of a campaign could vary greatly depending on the culture and values of the country in which it was launched. Also, the fundraising goals are all in different currencies.

The data includes less than 15 campaigns that launched in 2009 and over 1000 campaigns launched in 2015.

***What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?***

We could look at outcomes based on length of campaign. It might also be helpful to narrow down a country and look at the theater/plays campaigns in just that country. It might also be interested to look at the length or descriptiveness of the campaign blurb and see if it has any impact on the outcome or even the number of donors.
